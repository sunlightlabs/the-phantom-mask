            <h3 class="faq__header" id="faq_what">What is this service?</h3>
            <p>
                Members of Congress donâ€™t have official emails, but they do have forms. This service makes navigating their complex contact forms
                as easy as emailing them. It allows you to contact them via email after you fill out your information just once.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq__group">
            <h3 class="faq__header" id="faq_how">How do I use this service?</h3>
            <p>
                Get started simply by sending a message to your representatives to <a href="mailto:myreps@opencongress.org">myreps@opencongress.org</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                You'll get a confirmation email with a link to sign up.
                Once you're signed up, we'll send off your first message to your representatives.
                From then on, you'll be able to continue writing to them by email instead of going through their contact forms.
            </p>

        <div class="faq__group">
            <h3 class="faq__header" id="faq_alternatives">Is there another way to contact Congress?</h3>
            <p>
                Yes! You can call, fax or mail a message and show up to their offices in person to discuss issues that
                are important to you.
                <a href="https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials" target="_new">Look up how to contact them</a> on usa.gov.

        <div class="faq__group">
            <h3 class="faq__header" id="faq_tips">What are some tips on communicating with Congress?</h3>
            {% include 'partials/faq_tips.html' %}
        </div>

        <div class="faq__group">
            <h3 class="faq__header" id="faq_titles">Why can I only select the three titles: Mr., Mrs. and Ms.?</h3>
            <p>
                Many congressional webforms require a title, but there is no standard list across offices.
                Some include honorifics from medical, military and other professional fields, but
                the three options we provide are the minimum selection that spans all webforms.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq__group">
            <h3 class="faq__header" id="faq_errors">Why isn't my message being sent?</h3>
            <p>
                Message failures can occur for many reasons, some outside of your or our control.
            </p>
            <p>
                Messages can fail when there are issues on the congressional webforms we're passing your
                message through, or our system may need to be updated to reflect changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sometimes errors in the information from the message can cause issues, such as a lengthy message that
                exceeds the limit on webforms, which is set individually be each congressional office.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the address you entered does not fall in the congressional district you're trying to send
                your message to (or is not recognized by the congressional web form), it can result in an unsent message.
            </p>
