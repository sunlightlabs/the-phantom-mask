            <p>It’s not easy to get in touch with members of Congress. You have to navigate different, complicated web forms each time you want to send a message to your representatives.</p>
            <p>Now, with Email Congress you can use your own email to write to your reps. After you sign up, our technology does all the work, so all you have to do is send an email!</p>
            <p>Remember we aren’t Congress, we just help you communicate with your representatives.</p>
