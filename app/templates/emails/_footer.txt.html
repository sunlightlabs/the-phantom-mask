We are not Congress

Members of Congress don’t have official emails for the public to use. This service makes navigating their required webforms as easy as emailing them.
If you’d prefer to fill out the webform each time or would like another method of communication, look up your member of Congress here.

Have you moved? Let's make sure your information is up to date.
